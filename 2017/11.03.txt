=====================

I went to the mall today. They've become somewhat eerie these days with their automated shopkeepers waiting for customers that never come. Everything is prim and pristine, anticipating any number of people to keep the wheels of consumerism turning. I still find them awkward to talk to.

In the before I spent a few years working retail, right after the recession. I found my way behind a desk eventually, but I did spend a full decade doing customer service. I always felt like it killed my ability to genuinely interact with other people; but I can defintely say it killed my ability to interact with anybody in a customer service position. Talking to them is like trying to connect two identical connectors: super fun in bed, but generally useless for electronics.

Feeling bold, I just walked in the front door. It slid open for me silently and I was greeted by a grid of television screens purring to life. A fuzzy pair of feminine lips appeared on the screen as the camera moved away from them.

"Welcome to The Galleria. We hope your shopping experience leaves you with a sense of fulfillment today."

The temptation for destruction was nonzero, but I've always held back. I strode in as lights begin to switch on throughout the complex. Demonstration units came alive, and I noticed a strangely artifical scent of cinnamon on the air. I stared back at the video wall.

log.recent :> All components functional and calibrated. Powering off.
log.recent :> This log is 2 days old, next maintenance is scheduled 5 days from now.

Weekly maintenance.....for how many years. And everything is still in perfect working order. I still don't really know how they keep at it without breaking.

I pressed further into the labryinth of pristine marble (or something like marble), and suddenly curious, looked for a stationary store. After a few minutes exploration, I saw one that should have fit the bill. The name above it glowing in cerulean even matched my memory of a stationary store from before. Of course the writing supplies we all out of stock, as always. Stuffed animals, scissors, stickers, anything you could imagine, but nothing to write with and nothing to write on.
