When you're queer you don't have the option of staying friends with your 'default friends'. There's too much bigotry in our society to be able to stay friends with people you've met at school and work. Hell, even family....perhaps especially family, falls right in line with random queerphobia. In a way, at least to me, part of being queer is having to curate good people, and cut out the bad.

I didn't really come out at once. I came out to certain people, while staying closeting to others for a time, hoping to eventually be entirely out. I am essentailly out in my private life, though I often find myself explaining my queerness to new people that enter my life. Professionally is quite a bit different. At work my queerness is best described as an open secret. For years only people I happened to befriend, none of which were in my department, knew. Management most likely does not know, and none of my direct coworkers have ever known until recently. I stealth for safety and ease, as much as it hurts me to do so.

I remember coming out to the 'default' friends of my teen years, only one of which I'm still in contact with. Hostility is the best word I can use to describe their general reaction. They're off succeeding, almost as a birthright, while I and my queer friends are left behind. I think of all the time I've spent trying to figure out who I am....all the time they could use on building lives because society simply told them who they were. "You will go into the world, find somebody who has different gentials than yours, which DEFINITELY determines their gender, make a shit ton of money together and breed like bunnies until you die!" Fuck that noise....but where does that leave me?

My family was initially supportive, though when they realized that the situation was more complex they became apathetic. Eventually came the strains of "I don't see why this is so important to you", and "Well I guess you're definitely the black sheep." Maybe it really is too much to ask people to be empathetic. I've mostly stopped spending time with them. Every interaction is just uncomfortable as they ask impolite questions, and pry into my life.

The behavior of self preservation is, of course, at odds with the idea of progress. I didn't want to lose my social ties with family and friends from school, I wanted to be accepted and loved. The ideal outcome is one where they realize that my queerness is important to me, doesn't affect them in any real way, and we continue to be close. By cutting them out I save myself, but I remove the chance of acceptance.

That's easily rebuked though, they're more than welcome to approach me and ask how to re-enter my life. They just don't. This makes me question how close we ever were, and other dark broodings in this vein. The reality is probably closer to them just being tired, and not having the mental bandwidth to deal with anything outside of their comfort zone.

I remember coming out to a small group of friends that I used to play WoW with. Their response was a simple, "So what?" It made me feel hollow and useless to hear this response, but it took me years to figure out exactly why. They may have thought that they were showing acceptance, being modern, cool, and what has lately been called 'woke', but instead all I heard was, 'We hear this things you're telling us that you think is important, and we don't care'. I care, which is why I told them. Being queer is core to my being, the least they could have done was be supportive.
